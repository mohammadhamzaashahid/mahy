            "High-density compressed wood blocks are manufactured from recycled wood chips that are bonded under high pressure and temperature, resulting in a uniform, solid, and highly durable structure with excellent load-bearing capacity. These blocks are eco-friendly and sustainable, produced using 100% recycled wood material, which helps reduce waste while supporting responsible manufacturing practices and meeting environmental and export compliance standards.",
            "They are precision-molded to ensure consistent size, density, and structural integrity, allowing for smooth pallet assembly and compatibility with automated nailing systems and pallet production lines. Available in a wide range of standard sizes, including 148 × 100 mm, 165 × 80 mm, 95 × 95 mm, 148 × 80 mm, and 155 × 100 mm, these blocks can accommodate various industrial requirements.",
            "In addition, the blocks are moisture and pest resistant, as they are heat-treated and dried to optimal moisture levels, preventing fungal growth, insect infestation, and decay. This makes them highly suitable for export pallets and global shipping standards. With high load-bearing strength, they are engineered to withstand heavy industrial loads, forklift handling, and long-distance transportation without deformation or cracking."

In addition, custom density and strength grades can be provided, enabling the production of blocks with varying density levels suited for light-duty, medium-duty, or heavy-duty load requirements. To support efficient handling and logistics, flexible packaging and palletization options are available, including shrink-wrapping, strapping, or bulk packing, depending on customer preferences and operational needs."
