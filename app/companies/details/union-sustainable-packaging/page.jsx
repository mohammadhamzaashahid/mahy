                description="Sustainability is integral to USPS’s operations. All compressed blocks and repair programs use 100% recycled wood, diverting millions of kilograms of used lumber from waste. Their facility repairs or reuses old pallets and recycles offcuts into new blocks (through Union Wood Works), embodying a “repair-reuse-recycle” approach. The compressed blocks require no chemicals or heat treatment (reducing emissions and contamination risk) and are naturally pest-free. These practices align with UAE and Middle East green initiatives (UAE Green Agenda 2030) and PalletBiz’s circular-economy goals. By providing reusable pallets and promoting pallet pooling, USPS helps customers lower their carbon footprint and total packaging cost."
